# Video Foreground

A demonstration of a green screen-like cutout of live video over different image backgrounds in the browser.

Uses [TensorFlow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) and [BodyPix](https://github.com/google-coral/project-bodypix), with a comparison to [the MediaPipe implementation](https://chuoling.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/selfie_segmentation.html), for person segmentation.
